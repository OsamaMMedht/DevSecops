# DevSecOps CI Pipeline Example using Bandit and Docker Scout

This project demonstrates a simple DevSecOps pipeline focused on **code and container image scanning**.  
It integrates two key tools:
- **Bandit** for Python static code analysis  
- **Docker Scout** for container vulnerability scanning

## Objective

Help developers identify and fix security issues early in the development cycle.  
Security checks are part of the CI pipeline, and we **enable artifact upload** to assist in tracking and resolving findings.

## Stack

- GitHub Actions
- Python
- Bandit
- Docker Scout
- Dockerfile
- GitHub Artifacts

## How It Works

1. On push or PR, GitHub Actions triggers
2. Bandit scans Python code for common security issues
3. Docker Scout scans the built Docker image
4. Scan results are:
   - Shown in the GitHub Actions logs
   - Saved as downloadable artifacts for review

## Why Artifacts Matter

Artifacts allow developers and security teams to:
- Review scan reports offline
- Track scan history
- Open issues with exact findings attached
- Speed up remediation

## Pipeline Highlights

- Fail the build if Bandit or Docker Scout finds high-severity issues
- Upload Bandit JSON report and Docker Scout summary as artifacts
- Simple, clean structure to build upon for full DevSecOps flow

## Future Improvements
Add Trivy or Snyk for deeper image scanning

Include secrets scanning (e.g., Gitleaks)

Add dependency scanning (e.g., pip-audit)

Slack/Teams alerts for failed scans
